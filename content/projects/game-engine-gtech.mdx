# Custom Game Engine — GTech3

A comprehensive game engine developed from scratch during my GTech3 curriculum, featuring a modern OpenGL renderer and entity-component-system architecture.

## 🎯 Context

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 6 months (full year course) |
| **Team** | Individual project |
| **Role** | Solo developer |
| **Status** | 🟢 Completed |

This engine was built progressively throughout my third year, implementing core game engine systems from scratch to understand the fundamentals of real-time graphics and game architecture.

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| Language | C++20 |
| Graphics | OpenGL 4.5, GLSL |
| UI | Dear ImGui |
| Math | GLM |
| Build | CMake |

## 🚀 Key Features

- **OpenGL Renderer**: Modern deferred rendering pipeline
- **ECS Architecture**: Data-oriented entity management
- **Scene Graph**: Hierarchical transform system
- **Editor Tools**: ImGui-based level editor
- **Asset Pipeline**: Model and texture loading
- **Shader System**: Hot-reloading GLSL shaders

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Rendering Pipeline

Implemented a deferred rendering pipeline with:
- G-buffer for geometry pass
- Lighting pass with multiple light types
- Post-processing effects (bloom, tone mapping)
- Shadow mapping

### Entity-Component-System

Data-oriented design separating:
- Entities as IDs
- Components as pure data
- Systems for behavior

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- 3D graphics programming fundamentals
- Game engine architecture patterns
- Memory management and optimization
- Tool development for game creation

## 📚 Academic Project

Developed during GTech3 Game Engine course. Code available upon request.
