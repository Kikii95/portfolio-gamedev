# DAW Custom

A personal Digital Audio Workstation built from scratch for creating mashups and designing custom sounds like kicks and synthesizers.

## 🎯 Context

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | Ongoing (started Jan 2026) |
| **Team** | Solo |
| **Status** | 🟡 Active Development |

I wanted a DAW tailored specifically for mashup creation and sound design — without the bloat of commercial DAWs. Building it myself also gave me deep knowledge of audio programming and DSP fundamentals.

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| Language | C++20 |
| Framework | JUCE 7 (GPL) |
| Build | CMake 3.22+ |
| Audio | Real-time audio processing, ASIO |

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-track Mixer**: Timeline-based editing with per-track volume and pan controls
- **Audio Import/Export**: Support for WAV, MP3, and FLAC formats
- **Built-in Effects**: EQ, Compressor, Reverb, and Delay processors
- **Kick Designer**: Custom kick drum synthesizer for electronic music
- **Basic Synthesizer**: Oscillator-based synth with filter and envelope
- **VST3 Hosting**: Load and use third-party VST3 plugins

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Real-time Audio Processing

The audio engine processes samples in real-time at 44.1kHz/48kHz sample rates with low latency. Each effect is implemented as a modular audio processor that can be chained together.

### DSP Implementation

All effects are implemented from scratch using standard DSP algorithms — biquad filters for EQ, RMS-based compression, Schroeder reverb, and delay lines with feedback.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- Deep understanding of real-time audio constraints
- DSP algorithm implementation (filters, effects)
- JUCE framework architecture
- Plugin hosting and VST3 integration
