| **Status** | 🟢 Complete |

When developing with multiple services (backend, frontend, database), you often face duplicate processes, port conflicts, and no visibility into what's running. This tool solves all of that.

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| Framework | Tauri 2.0 |
| Backend | Rust |
| Frontend | React, TypeScript |
| Platform | Windows, Linux |

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Start/Stop/Restart**: Manage services with one click
- **Status Dashboard**: See all services at a glance
- **Health Checks**: HTTP endpoint monitoring
- **Dependencies**: Start services in the correct order
- **History Tracking**: See what ran and when
- **WSL Support**: Manage WSL projects from Windows

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Service Management

Services are defined in a simple YAML config. The tracker monitors process state, handles graceful shutdown, and can restart crashed services automatically.

### WSL Integration

The tracker can execute commands in WSL distributions, allowing you to manage Linux-based development services from a Windows GUI.
