# SIMD Math Optimization

A high-performance math library leveraging SIMD instructions for vectorized operations commonly used in game engines.

## 🎯 Context

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 4 weeks |
| **Team** | Individual competition |
| **Role** | Solo developer |
| **Status** | 🟢 Completed |

This project was part of a performance optimization challenge, implementing math operations using SIMD intrinsics to achieve maximum throughput.

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| Language | C++ |
| Intrinsics | SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2 |
| Benchmarking | Custom profiler |
| Build | CMake |

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Vector Math**: Vec2, Vec3, Vec4 with SIMD backing
- **Matrix Operations**: 4x4 matrices with vectorized multiply
- **Quaternions**: SIMD-optimized rotations
- **Batch Processing**: Transform arrays of vectors
- **Fallback Path**: Scalar implementations for compatibility

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### SIMD Architecture

Leveraged x86 SIMD extensions:
- **SSE**: 128-bit registers, 4x float parallel
- **AVX**: 256-bit registers, 8x float parallel
- Memory alignment for optimal load/store

### Optimizations

Techniques employed:
- Data layout optimization (SoA vs AoS)
- Cache-friendly access patterns
- Instruction-level parallelism
- Branch elimination

## 📊 Performance Results

| Operation | Scalar | SIMD | Speedup |
|-----------|--------|------|---------|
| Vec4 dot | 4 ops | 1 op | ~4x |
| Mat4 mul | 64 ops | 16 ops | ~4x |
| Batch transform | N ops | N/4 ops | ~4x |
