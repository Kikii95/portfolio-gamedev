# Obsidian Web

A modern web-based viewer and editor for Obsidian vaults, powered by GitHub as the backend storage. Access your notes from any device with a web browser.

## 🎯 Context

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 2 weeks |
| **Team** | Solo |
| **Status** | 🟢 Live |

I needed a way to access my Obsidian vault on my phone without paying for Obsidian Sync. By using GitHub as the sync layer, I get free, reliable synchronization between all my devices.

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| Frontend | React, TypeScript |
| Styling | TailwindCSS |
| Backend | GitHub API (no server) |
| Hosting | Vercel |
| Features | PWA, OAuth |

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Mobile Access**: Full Obsidian-like experience on any device
- **GitHub Sync**: Your vault stays on GitHub — no proprietary sync
- **PWA Support**: Works offline, installable as app
- **Graph View**: Visual note connections
- **Backlinks**: See what links to each note
- **Daily Notes**: Quick access to daily journal
- **Tags**: Full tag support with filtering

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Serverless Architecture

The entire app runs client-side with no backend server. Authentication uses GitHub OAuth, and all data operations go directly through the GitHub API. Your token is stored in an encrypted JWT cookie.

### Security Model

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Auth | GitHub OAuth |
| Storage | JWT cookie (no server database) |
| Access | Only configured repos |
| Data | Never stored on our servers |
