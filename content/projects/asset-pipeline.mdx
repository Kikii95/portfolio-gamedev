# Asset Pipeline Engine

A robust asset management system for game engines, handling loading, caching, hot-reloading, and dependency resolution.

## 🎯 Context

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 5 weeks |
| **Team** | Group project (3 people) |
| **Role** | Core pipeline architect |
| **Status** | 🟢 Completed |

Modern games require sophisticated asset management. This project implements a production-ready pipeline for handling game resources.

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| Language | C++ |
| Build | CMake |
| Serialization | Custom binary format |
| File Watching | Platform-specific APIs |

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Async Loading**: Background asset loading with callbacks
- **Reference Counting**: Automatic resource lifetime management
- **Hot Reloading**: Live asset updates during development
- **Dependency Graph**: Automatic reload of dependent assets
- **Compression**: LZ4 compression for packed assets

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Resource Manager

Centralized system handling:
- Asset registration and lookup
- Memory budgeting
- Load prioritization
- Garbage collection

### Build Pipeline

Offline processing for:
- Texture compression (BCn formats)
- Mesh optimization
- Shader compilation
- Asset bundling

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- Resource management patterns
- Asynchronous programming
- File system abstractions
- Memory management strategies

## 📚 Academic Project

Developed during GTech3 Engine Architecture course. Code available upon request.
