# FBX Parser — 3D File Format

A custom parser for the FBX binary format, enabling import of 3D models, skeletal animations, and scene hierarchies.

## 🎯 Context

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 5 weeks |
| **Team** | Group project (3 people) |
| **Role** | Binary parser implementation |
| **Status** | 🟢 Completed |

Understanding 3D file formats is essential for game development. This project dives deep into the FBX binary specification.

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| Language | C++ |
| Build | CMake |
| Format | FBX Binary (7.x) |
| Compression | zlib for FBX compression |

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Binary Format Parsing**: Low-level FBX node traversal
- **Mesh Extraction**: Vertices, normals, UVs, indices
- **Material Support**: Basic material properties
- **Scene Hierarchy**: Transform parent-child relationships
- **Animation Data**: Keyframe extraction

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### FBX Binary Structure

The FBX binary format uses:
- Node-based tree structure
- Property arrays with various data types
- Optional zlib compression
- Custom encoding for strings and arrays

### Data Extraction

Implemented extraction of:
- Geometry (vertices, polygons, normals)
- UV mappings (multiple channels)
- Bone weights for skinning
- Animation curves

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- Binary file format reverse engineering
- 3D data structures and transformations
- Memory-efficient parsing strategies
- Integration with rendering systems

## 📚 Academic Project

Developed during GTech3 Tools Programming course. Code available upon request.
