# Multithreaded Game

Game demonstrating advanced C++ multithreading techniques for smooth gameplay.

## Context

School project GTech3, 2 months. Team of 4, role: core systems developer.

Focus on parallel processing and thread synchronization for real-time game systems.

## Requirements

School requirements:
- Parallelize at least 2 game systems
- Thread-safe resource management
- Stable frame time < 16ms (60 FPS)
- C++17/20 with std::thread, no race conditions

## Stack

- C++17/20
- CMake
- SFML (graphics)
- std::thread, mutex, condition variables

## Our Implementation

Beyond the 2 systems required, we implemented a complete architecture:

- **4 dedicated threads**: Main (game loop + input), Render, Physics, Audio — vs 2 required
- **Custom job system**: scalable parallelism with work stealing, not just fixed threads
- **Lock-free structures**: SPSC/MPSC queues to minimize contention
- **Built-in profiler**: frame time visualization per system, bottleneck identification

## Technical Details

Multi-threaded architecture with dedicated threads:
- Main: game loop coordination + input
- Render: graphics submission
- Physics: collision and simulation
- Audio: sound processing

Synchronization via mutex locks, atomic operations and condition variables to avoid race conditions while maintaining performance.
