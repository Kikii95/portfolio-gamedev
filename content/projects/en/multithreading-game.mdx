  ## Multi-Thread Architecture

  4 dedicated threads vs 2 required:

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │              Thread Pool                │
  ├──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬────────┤
  │   Main   │  Render  │ Physics  │ Audio  │
  │ (loop +  │ (submit  │(collision│(sound  │
  │  input)  │ graphics)│  + sim)  │process)│
  └──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴────────┘
  ```

  ## Tech Stack

  | Tech | Version | Role |
  |------|---------|------|
  | C++ | 17/20 | Core language |
  | std::thread | stdlib | Threading primitives |
  | std::mutex | stdlib | Synchronization |
  | SFML | 2.5 | Graphics |
  | CMake | 3.x | Build system |

  ## Synchronization

  - **Mutex locks**: critical sections
  - **Condition variables**: inter-thread signaling
  - **Atomics**: lock-free counters and flags
  - **SPSC/MPSC queues**: contention-free communication

  ## Performance

  - Stable frame time < 16ms (60 FPS)
  - Custom job system with work stealing
  - Built-in profiler for bottleneck identification

# Multithreaded Game

Game demonstrating advanced C++ multithreading techniques for smooth gameplay.

## Context

School project GTech3, 2 months. Team of 4, role: core systems developer.

Focus on parallel processing and thread synchronization for real-time game systems.

## School Requirements

- Parallelize at least 2 game systems
- Thread-safe resource management
- Stable frame time < 16ms (60 FPS)
- C++17/20 with std::thread, no race conditions

## Our Implementation

Beyond the 2 required systems:

- **4 dedicated threads**: Main, Render, Physics, Audio
- **Custom job system** with work stealing
- **Lock-free structures**: SPSC/MPSC queues
- **Built-in profiler**: frame time visualization
