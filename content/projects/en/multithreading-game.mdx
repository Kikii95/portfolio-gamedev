# Multithreaded Game

Game demonstrating advanced C++ multithreading techniques for smooth gameplay.

## Context

School project GTech3, 2 months. Team of 4, role: core systems developer.

Focus on parallel processing and thread synchronization for real-time game systems.

## Requirements

Project objectives:
- Parallelize game systems (render, physics, logic)
- Thread-safe resource management
- Implement a job system
- Optimize for consistent frame times

Constraints:
- C++17/20 with std::thread
- No detectable race conditions
- Stable frame time < 16ms (60 FPS)
- Performance profiling and documentation

## Stack

- C++17/20
- CMake
- SFML (graphics)
- std::thread, mutex, condition variables

## Features

- Parallelized game systems (render, physics, logic on separate threads)
- Thread-safe resource management (lock-free structures when possible)
- Performance optimization for consistent frame times
- Job system for scalable parallelism

## Technical Details

Multi-threaded architecture with dedicated threads:
- Main: game loop coordination + input
- Render: graphics submission
- Physics: collision and simulation
- Audio: sound processing

Synchronization via mutex locks, atomic operations and condition variables to avoid race conditions while maintaining performance.
