  ## Architecture

  Modular audio engine with chainable effect processors:

  ```
  Audio Input → [Effect Chain] → Mixer → Output
                    │
      ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
      │             │             │
    EQ      Compressor      Reverb
  (Biquad)    (RMS)      (Schroeder)
  ```

  ## Tech Stack

  | Tech | Version | Role |
  |------|---------|------|
  | C++ | 20 | Core language |
  | JUCE | 7 | Audio framework (GPL) |
  | CMake | 3.22+ | Build system |
  | ASIO | - | Minimal real-time latency |
  | ALSA | - | Linux backend |

  ## DSP Implementation

  - **Parametric EQ**: Biquad filters per band
  - **Compressor**: RMS detection, attack/release
  - **Reverb**: Schroeder algorithm
  - **Delay**: Delay lines with feedback

  ## Specifications

  - Sample rates: 44.1kHz / 48kHz
  - Latency: minimal via ASIO
  - License: GPL v3 (due to JUCE)

# DAW Custom

Personal audio workstation for creating mashups and designing sounds (kicks, synths).

## Context

Personal project started in November 2025. Solo development.

Goal: a DAW tailored for mashup creation and sound design, without commercial DAW bloat. Building it myself to deeply understand audio processing.

## What it does

**Mixer**:
- Multi-track with timeline
- WAV, MP3, FLAC import/export
- VST3 hosting

**Built-in effects**:
- Parametric EQ
- Compressor
- Reverb
- Delay

**Sound design**:
- Kick Designer for electronic music
- Basic synthesizer (oscillators, filter, envelope)
