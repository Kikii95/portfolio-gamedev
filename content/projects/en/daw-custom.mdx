# DAW Custom

Personal audio workstation for creating mashups and designing sounds (kicks, synths).

Personal project started in November 2025. Solo development.

Goal: a DAW tailored for mashup creation and sound design, without commercial DAW bloat. Building it myself to deeply understand audio processing.

## Stack

- C++20
- JUCE 7 (audio framework, GPL license)
- CMake 3.22+
- ASIO for real-time

Linux dependencies: ALSA, X11, graphics libs

## Specifications

- Real-time audio engine: 44.1/48kHz
- Minimal latency via ASIO
- License: GPL v3 (due to JUCE GPL)

## Features

Mixer:
- Multi-track with timeline
- WAV, MP3, FLAC import/export
- VST3 hosting

Built-in effects:
- Parametric EQ
- Compressor
- Reverb
- Delay

Sound design:
- Kick Designer for electronic music
- Basic synthesizer (oscillators, filter, envelope)

## Technical Details

Each effect is a chainable modular audio processor.

DSP implemented from scratch:
- Biquad filters for EQ
- RMS compression
- Schroeder reverb
- Delay lines with feedback
