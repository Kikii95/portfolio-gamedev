# DAW Custom

Personal audio workstation for creating mashups and designing sounds (kicks, synths).

## Context

Personal project started in November 2025. Solo development.

Goal: a DAW tailored for mashup creation and sound design, without commercial DAW bloat. Building it myself to deeply understand audio processing.

## Stack

- C++20
- JUCE 7 (GPL)
- CMake 3.22+
- ASIO for real-time

## Features

- Multi-track mixer with timeline
- WAV, MP3, FLAC import/export
- Built-in effects: EQ, Compressor, Reverb, Delay
- Kick Designer for electronic music
- Basic synthesizer (oscillators, filter, envelope)
- VST3 hosting

## Technical Details

Real-time audio engine at 44.1/48kHz with minimal latency. Each effect is a chainable modular audio processor.

DSP implemented from scratch: biquad filters for EQ, RMS compression, Schroeder reverb, delay lines with feedback.
