# ECS Template

Universal Entity Component System engine in C++20. Modular architecture, reusable for all types of 2D games.

## Context

School project GTech3 started in November 2025, solo development for the Game Libre course.

Goal: create a reusable engine as a base for other projects, with a clean and extensible architecture.

## Stack

- C++20
- SFML 2.5+ (rendering)
- CMake 3.20+
- Patterns: ECS, Factory, Observer

## Architecture

Statistics:
- 36 modular Components
- 35 decoupled Systems
- 8+ Modules (core, transform, graphics, gameplay, inventory, interaction, AI, audio, network)

System types:
- Active: continuous execution (render, physics)
- Reactive: event response
- TurnBased: turn-based games
- UI: user interface

Supported game types:
- Real-time: FPS, platformers, action
- Turn-based: strategy, tactical RPG
- Grid-based: roguelikes, puzzles
- Hybrid: mode combinations

## Features

- Pure ECS architecture: entities as IDs, components as data, systems for behavior
- Total logic/data decoupling
- Memory pooling for frequent allocations
- Spatial hashing for collisions
- Thread-safe with mutexes and atomics
- Memory-safe with smart pointers and RAII
- Complete documentation

## Technical Details

Collision optimization via spatial hashing:
- O(n) instead of O(n²)
- 125 entities: 25x faster (125,000 → 1,000 checks)
- 1000 entities: 250x faster (500,000 → 2,000 checks)

## Demo

Pirate Space Explorer: complete demo game using the engine.
