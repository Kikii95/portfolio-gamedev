  ## ECS Architecture

  Pure Entity-Component-System architecture:

  ```
  Entity (ID)
      │
      ├── Component A (Data)
      ├── Component B (Data)
      └── Component C (Data)
           │
           └── Systems (Behavior)
               ├── Active (continuous)
               ├── Reactive (event-driven)
               └── TurnBased (discrete)
  ```

  ## Tech Stack

  | Tech | Version | Role |
  |------|---------|------|
  | C++ | 20 | Core language |
  | SFML | 2.5+ | 2D rendering |
  | CMake | 3.20+ | Build system |
  | Patterns | ECS, Factory, Observer | Architecture |

  ## Statistics

  - **36 Components** modular
  - **35 Systems** decoupled
  - **8+ Modules**: core, transform, graphics, gameplay, inventory, interaction, AI, audio, network

  ## Collision Optimizations

  Spatial hashing O(n) vs O(n²):

  | Entities | Brute Force | Spatial Hash | Speedup |
  |----------|-------------|--------------|---------|
  | 125 | 125,000 checks | 1,000 checks | 25x |
  | 1000 | 500,000 checks | 2,000 checks | 250x |

  ## Memory Safety

  - Smart pointers + RAII
  - Memory pooling for frequent allocations
  - Thread-safe with mutexes and atomics

# ECS Template

Universal Entity Component System engine in C++20. Modular architecture, reusable for all types of 2D games.

## Context

School project GTech3 started in November 2025, solo development for the Game Libre course.

Goal: create a reusable engine as a base for other projects, with a clean and extensible architecture.

## What it does

**Supported game types**:
- Real-time: FPS, platformers, action
- Turn-based: strategy, tactical RPG
- Grid-based: roguelikes, puzzles
- Hybrid: mode combinations

**Architecture**:
- Entities as pure IDs
- Components as data
- Systems for behavior
- Total logic/data decoupling

**Demo**: Pirate Space Explorer — complete game using the engine.
