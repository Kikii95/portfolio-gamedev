# ECS Template

Universal Entity Component System engine in C++20. Modular architecture, reusable for all types of 2D games.

## Context

School project GTech3 started in November 2025, solo development for the Game Libre course.

Goal: create a reusable engine as a base for other projects, with a clean and extensible architecture.

## Stack

- C++20
- SFML (rendering)
- CMake
- Patterns: ECS, Factory, Observer

## Features

- 36 modular Components
- 35 decoupled Systems
- Extensible architecture
- Optimizations: spatial hashing, memory pooling
- Complete documentation

## Technical Details

Pure ECS architecture: entities as IDs, components as data, systems for behavior. Total decoupling between logic and data.

Performance: spatial hashing for collisions, memory pooling for frequent allocations.

## Demo

Pirate Space Explorer: complete demo game using the engine.
