# Asset Pipeline Engine

Robust asset management system for game engines: loading, caching, hot-reload and dependency resolution.

## Context

School project GTech3, 5 weeks. Team of 3, role: core pipeline architect.

Modern games require sophisticated asset management. This project implements a production-ready pipeline for game resources.

## Stack

- C++
- CMake
- Custom binary serialization
- System APIs (file watching)

## Features

- Async loading with callbacks
- Reference counting: automatic resource lifecycle management
- Hot reload: live asset updates during development
- Dependency graph: automatic reload of dependent assets
- LZ4 compression for packed assets

## Technical Details

Centralized Resource Manager handling:
- Asset registration and lookup
- Memory budget
- Load prioritization
- Garbage collection

Offline build pipeline for:
- Texture compression (BCn formats)
- Mesh optimization
- Shader compilation
- Asset bundling
