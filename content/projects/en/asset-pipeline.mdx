# Asset Pipeline Engine

Robust asset management system for game engines: loading, caching, hot-reload and dependency resolution.

## Context

School project GTech3, 5 weeks. Team of 3, role: core pipeline architect.

Modern games require sophisticated asset management. This project implements a production-ready pipeline for game resources.

## Requirements

School requirements:
- Implement a resource loading system
- Automatic memory management
- Hot-reload support
- Modern C++, technical documentation, unit tests

## Stack

- C++
- CMake
- Custom binary serialization
- System APIs (file watching)

## Our Implementation

Beyond the requirements, we chose to implement:

- **Async loading with callbacks**: prioritizing on-screen visible assets
- **Reference counting**: automatic lifecycle management, prevents memory leaks
- **Smart hot reload**: native file watcher + dependency graph for automatic reload of linked assets
- **LZ4 compression**: 60% bundle size reduction for packed assets

## Technical Details

Centralized Resource Manager handling:
- Asset registration and lookup
- Memory budget
- Load prioritization
- Garbage collection

Offline build pipeline for:
- Texture compression (BCn formats)
- Mesh optimization
- Shader compilation
- Asset bundling
