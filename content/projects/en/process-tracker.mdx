# Process Tracker

Desktop app to manage local development services. No more duplicate processes, port conflicts and uncertainty about what's running.

## Context

Personal project started in December 2025. Solo development over one week.

Problem solved: when developing with multiple services (backend, frontend, database), you often end up with duplicate processes, port conflicts, and no visibility on what's running.

## Stack

- Tauri 2.0
- Rust (backend)
- React, TypeScript (frontend)
- Cross-platform: Windows, Linux

## Features

- Start/Stop/Restart services in one click
- Global status dashboard
- HTTP health checks
- Service dependency management
- Execution history
- WSL support from Windows

## Technical Details

Services are defined in a simple YAML file. The tracker monitors process state, handles graceful shutdown and can auto-restart crashed services.

WSL integration: can execute commands in WSL distributions, allowing Linux service management from a Windows GUI.
