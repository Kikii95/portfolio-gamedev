# Process Tracker

Desktop app to manage local development services. No more duplicate processes, port conflicts and uncertainty about what's running.

## Context

Personal project started in December 2025. Solo development over one week.

Problem solved: when developing with multiple services (backend, frontend, database), you often end up with duplicate processes, port conflicts, and no visibility on what's running.

## Stack

- Tauri 2.0 (desktop framework)
- Rust (backend)
- React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS (frontend)
- Vite (build)
- Cross-platform: Windows, Linux

## Configuration

- `.ptrc` JSON file to define services (commit to Git)
- `.pt-registry.json` for runtime state (ignore in Git)
- Environment variable support
- Customizable health check timeouts

## Features

Service management:
- One-click Start/Stop/Restart
- Global status dashboard
- HTTP health checks
- Service dependency management
- Execution history

Advanced:
- External process detection (services started elsewhere)
- Service groups for batch operations
- WSL support from Windows
- Auto-restart crashed services

## Technical Details

Services are defined in a simple YAML/JSON file. The tracker monitors process state, handles graceful shutdown and can auto-restart crashed services.

WSL integration: can execute commands in WSL distributions, allowing Linux service management from a Windows GUI.
