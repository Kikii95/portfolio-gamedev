  ## Architecture

  Tauri app with Rust-side process management:

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │           React Dashboard           │
  │   (Service cards + Status monitor)  │
  └──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                 │ IPC
  ┌──────────────┴──────────────────────┐
  │           Rust Process Manager      │
  │  (spawn, health check, restart)     │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```

  ## Tech Stack

  | Tech | Version | Role |
  |------|---------|------|
  | Tauri | 2.0 | Desktop framework |
  | Rust | 1.77+ | Process management |
  | React | 18 | UI dashboard |
  | TypeScript | 5 | Frontend typing |
  | TailwindCSS | 3 | Styling |
  | Vite | 5 | Build tooling |

  ## Configuration

  ```json
  // .ptrc (commit to Git)
  {
    "services": [
      { "name": "api", "command": "pnpm dev", "port": 3000 },
      { "name": "db", "command": "docker start postgres" }
    ]
  }
  ```

  - `.ptrc`: service definitions (versioned)
  - `.pt-registry.json`: runtime state (gitignored)
  - Environment variable support
  - Configurable health check timeouts

  ## Advanced Features

  - External process detection
  - Service groups (batch operations)
  - WSL support from Windows
  - Auto-restart on crash

# Process Tracker

Desktop app to manage local development services. No more duplicate processes, port conflicts and uncertainty.

## Context

Personal project started in December 2025. Solo development over one week.

Problem solved: when developing with multiple services (backend, frontend, database), you often end up with duplicate processes, port conflicts, and no visibility on what's running.

## What it does

**Service management**:
- One-click Start/Stop/Restart
- Global status dashboard
- Automatic HTTP health checks
- Service dependency management
- Execution history

**Advanced**:
- External process detection
- Service groups for batch operations
- WSL support from Windows
- Auto-restart crashed services
