# SIMD Math Optimization

High-performance math library using SIMD instructions for vector and matrix operations in game engines.

## Context

School project GTech3, optimization competition, 4 weeks. Individual project.

Implementing math operations with SIMD intrinsics to achieve maximum throughput.

## Requirements

Project objectives:
- Implement a SIMD math library (SSE/AVX)
- Benchmark against scalar implementation
- Achieve minimum 4x speedup
- Fallback for non-SIMD platforms

Constraints:
- x86 intrinsics (no inline assembly)
- SSE4.2 minimum support, AVX optional
- Numerical precision tests
- Optimization techniques documentation

## Stack

- C++
- SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2 (intrinsics)
- Custom profiler
- CMake

## Features

- Vector math: Vec2, Vec3, Vec4 with SIMD backing
- Matrix operations: 4x4 matrices with vectorized multiplication
- Quaternions: SIMD-optimized rotations
- Batch processing: vector array transformation
- Scalar fallback for compatibility

## Technical Details

x86 SIMD extensions used:
- SSE: 128-bit registers, 4 floats in parallel
- AVX: 256-bit registers, 8 floats in parallel
- Memory alignment for optimal load/store

Optimization techniques:
- Data layout (SoA vs AoS)
- Cache-friendly access patterns
- Instruction-level parallelism
- Branch elimination

## Results

| Operation | Scalar | SIMD | Speedup |
|-----------|--------|------|---------|
| Vec4 dot | 4 ops | 1 op | ~4x |
| Mat4 mul | 64 ops | 16 ops | ~4x |
| Batch transform | N ops | N/4 ops | ~4x |
