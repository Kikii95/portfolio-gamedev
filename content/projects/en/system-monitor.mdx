# System Monitor

Terminal system performance monitor. Inspired by htop/btop/nvtop but lighter, written in Rust.

## Context

Personal project started in November 2025. Solo development over one week.

Goal: a minimalist system monitor, keyboard-driven, that consumes almost nothing while being visually pleasing.

## Stack

- Rust 1.75+
- Ratatui (TUI framework)
- NVML (NVIDIA GPU)
- Cross-platform: Linux, Windows, macOS, WSL2

## Features

- Near-zero consumption: 0.0% CPU, ~4MB RAM
- 9 visual themes (Matrix, Tokyo Night, etc.)
- NVIDIA GPU monitoring: usage, VRAM, temperature, power
- 60-second sparklines for all metrics
- Persistent config saved in one keypress
- Single 1.7MB binary

## Technical Details

Zero-overhead design: metrics are collected via native system APIs. The TUI only redraws when data changes.

GPU integration via NVIDIA's NVML library, real-time access to usage, memory, temperature and power consumption.
