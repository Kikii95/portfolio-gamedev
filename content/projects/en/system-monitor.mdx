# System Monitor

Terminal system performance monitor. Inspired by htop/btop/nvtop but lighter, written in Rust.

## Context

Personal project started in November 2025. Solo development over one week.

Goal: a minimalist system monitor, keyboard-driven, that consumes almost nothing while being visually pleasing.

## Stack

- Rust 1.75+
- Ratatui (TUI framework)
- sysinfo (system metrics)
- nvml-wrapper (NVIDIA GPU)
- Cross-platform: Linux, Windows, macOS, WSL2

## Features

Performance:
- Near-zero consumption: 0.0% CPU, ~4MB RAM
- Single 1.7MB binary
- Instant startup (<100ms)

Monitoring:
- CPU, RAM, Swap in real-time
- NVIDIA GPU: usage, VRAM, temperature, power draw
- 60-second sparklines for all metrics
- Processes sorted by consumption

Interface:
- 9 visual themes: Matrix, Dracula, Nord, Tokyo Night, Gruvbox, Cyberpunk, Ocean, Forest, Sunset
- Full keyboard navigation
- Persistent config saved in one keypress

## Technical Details

Zero-overhead design: metrics are collected via sysinfo (native system APIs). The TUI only redraws when data changes.

GPU integration via nvml-wrapper (NVIDIA's NVML library), real-time access to usage, memory, temperature and power consumption.

Config stored in `~/.config/system-monitor/config.toml` (Linux/WSL) or `%APPDATA%` (Windows).
