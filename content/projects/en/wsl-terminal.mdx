# WSL Terminal

Modern terminal emulator for WSL2. All features of a pro terminal, optimized for WSL development.

## Context

Personal project started in December 2025. Solo development over 2 weeks.

Windows Terminal is fine, but I wanted something with better developer integration: Git panels, Docker management, project navigation, customizable UI — without Electron's overhead.

## Stack

- Tauri 2.0
- Rust 1.77+ (backend)
- React 19, TypeScript 5, TailwindCSS 4 (frontend)
- xterm.js 5 with addons
- Zustand (state management)

## Features

Terminal:
- Multi-tabs with drag-and-drop
- Resizable horizontal/vertical split panes
- Multi-window (detach tabs)
- Automatic session restore
- Ctrl+F search

Dev tools:
- Git panel: branches, staging, commits, push/pull
- Docker panel: containers and images
- SSH manager: save and quick connect
- Project switcher by category
- Saved quick commands

UI:
- 6 themes (Catppuccin, Dracula, Nord, One Dark, Gruvbox, Tokyo Night)
- Command palette Ctrl+Shift+P
- Quake mode (dropdown terminal)
- Long command completion notifications

## Technical Details

Lightweight compared to Electron alternatives: ~15MB installer, 80-120MB RAM. Tauri backend handles shell spawning and IPC, React handles the UI.

Supports all installed WSL distributions (auto-detection), PowerShell and CMD. Project switcher integrates with my `~/projects/` structure.
