# Audio Editor

Desktop audio editor for WAV files with DSP effects, waveform visualization and real-time processing.

## Context

School project GTech3, 6 weeks. Team of 3, role: DSP and audio engine developer.

Exploring digital signal processing fundamentals through a practical audio editing application.

## Requirements

Project objectives:
- Parse and play WAV files (PCM)
- Real-time waveform display
- Implement DSP effects (EQ, compression, reverb, delay)
- Non-destructive editing with preview

Constraints:
- Windows audio API (XAudio2 or WASAPI)
- WAV formats 8/16/24-bit, mono/stereo
- Latency < 50ms for playback
- Functional user interface

## Stack

- C++
- XAudio2 (audio API)
- Custom WAV parser
- Win32 / ImGui (UI)

## Features

- WAV import/export (full PCM)
- Real-time waveform display
- DSP effects: EQ, compression, reverb, delay
- Non-destructive editing with effect chain preview
- Selection tools: cut, copy, paste audio regions

## Technical Details

Custom WAV parser handling:
- RIFF header parsing
- Multiple formats (8/16/24-bit, mono/stereo)
- Chunk navigation and metadata

Audio effects implemented from scratch:
- Biquad filters for EQ bands
- RMS compressor
- Delay line with feedback
- Convolution reverb basics
