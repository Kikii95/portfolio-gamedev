# Audio Editor

Desktop audio editor for WAV files with DSP effects, waveform visualization and real-time processing.

## Context

School project GTech3, 6 weeks. Team of 3, role: DSP and audio engine developer.

Exploring digital signal processing fundamentals through a practical audio editing application.

## Requirements

School requirements:
- Parse and play WAV files
- Waveform display
- Implement at least 2 DSP effects
- Windows audio API, latency < 50ms

## Stack

- C++
- XAudio2 (audio API)
- Custom WAV parser
- Win32 / ImGui (UI)

## Our Implementation

Beyond the requirements (2 effects requested), we pushed the project further:

- **4 complete DSP effects**: parametric EQ, RMS compression, convolution reverb, delay with feedback
- **Non-destructive editing**: effect chain preview before applying
- **Advanced selection tools**: cut, copy, paste audio regions with sample precision
- **Extended format support**: 8/16/24-bit, mono/stereo (beyond the required 16-bit)

## Technical Details

Custom WAV parser handling:
- RIFF header parsing
- Multiple formats (8/16/24-bit, mono/stereo)
- Chunk navigation and metadata

Audio effects implemented from scratch:
- Biquad filters for EQ bands
- RMS compressor
- Delay line with feedback
- Convolution reverb basics
