  ## Architecture

  Audio pipeline with chainable effects:

  ```
  WAV File → Parser → [Effect Chain] → XAudio2 → Output
                           │
        ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
        │                  │                  │
      EQ            Compressor           Reverb
   (Biquad)           (RMS)          (Convolution)
  ```

  ## Tech Stack

  | Tech | Version | Role |
  |------|---------|------|
  | C++ | 17 | Core language |
  | XAudio2 | Windows API | Real-time audio engine |
  | Win32/ImGui | - | User interface |
  | WAV Parser | Custom | Audio file reading |

  ## Custom WAV Parser

  - RIFF header parsing
  - Formats: 8/16/24-bit, mono/stereo
  - Chunk navigation and metadata
  - Beyond the required 16-bit

  ## DSP Effects Implemented

  - **Parametric EQ**: Biquad filters per band
  - **Compressor**: RMS detection with attack/release
  - **Reverb**: Convolution basics
  - **Delay**: Delay lines with feedback

  ## Specifications

  - Latency: < 50ms (Windows audio API)
  - Non-destructive editing with preview
  - Sample-accurate selection: cut/copy/paste

# Audio Editor

Desktop audio editor for WAV files with DSP effects, waveform visualization and real-time processing.

## Context

School project GTech3, 6 weeks. Team of 3, role: DSP and audio engine developer.

Exploring digital signal processing fundamentals through a practical audio editing application.

## School Requirements

- Parse and play WAV files
- Waveform display
- Implement at least 2 DSP effects
- Windows audio API, latency < 50ms

## Our Implementation

Beyond the requirements (2 effects required):

- **4 complete DSP effects**: EQ, compression, reverb, delay
- **Non-destructive editing**: preview before applying
- **Advanced selection tools**: sample-accurate cut/copy/paste
- **Extended format support**: 8/16/24-bit, mono/stereo
