# Hype

Private repo — Startup project

Mobile app to discover events and experiences around you.

## Context

Startup project started in June 2025. Role: Full-stack Developer. MVP phase.

Problem: finding things to do shouldn't require checking 10 different apps.

## Stack

- React Native, Expo (mobile)
- Next.js, TypeScript (web admin)
- REST API (backend)
- PostgreSQL
- pnpm monorepo

## Features

- Smart discovery based on preferences and location
- Real-time event updates
- Social integration: see friends' interests
- Cross-platform: native iOS and Android
- Web dashboard for organizers

## Technical Details

Monorepo architecture with pnpm, code sharing between mobile app, web dashboard and backend. Consistency guaranteed, minimal duplication.

Geolocation services for the discovery engine, relevant events based on proximity and travel preferences.
