# LLM Automation Platform

Private repo — Professional project

SaaS platform enabling creation of LLM-powered automation workflows without writing code.

## Context

Professional project started in September 2025. Role: Lead Developer. Small team.

The platform allows non-technical users to build complex automation workflows with LLMs, with enterprise-grade reliability and security.

## Stack

- Python 3.11+, FastAPI (backend)
- LangGraph, LangChain (AI orchestration)
- TypeScript, React (frontend)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker, Redis (infra)

## Features

- Multi-provider support: Claude, OpenAI, Ollama (local)
- Visual workflow builder with drag-and-drop
- RAG integration for custom knowledge bases
- Extensible plugin system
- Enterprise security: RBAC, audit logs

## Technical Details

Agent architecture with LangGraph for stateful multi-step workflows. Each agent can use tools, maintain conversation context and handle complex decision trees.

Multi-provider abstraction: unified interface allowing switching between Claude, GPT-4 and local Ollama models as needed.

Metrics: 77% test coverage, 1296 tests.
