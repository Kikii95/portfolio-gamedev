# FBX Parser

Custom parser for the FBX binary format, enabling import of 3D models, skeletal animations and scene hierarchies.

## Context

School project GTech3, 5 weeks. Team of 3, role: binary parser implementation.

Understanding 3D file formats is essential in game dev. This project dives into the FBX binary specification.

## Requirements

Project objectives:
- Parse FBX 7.x binary format
- Extract mesh, materials and animation data
- Reconstruct scene hierarchy
- Handle zlib decompression

Constraints:
- No official FBX SDK usage
- Support compressed and uncompressed files
- Export to simple intermediate format
- Documentation of parsed format

## Stack

- C++
- CMake
- FBX Binary (7.x)
- zlib (FBX compression)

## Features

- Binary format parsing: low-level FBX node traversal
- Mesh extraction: vertices, normals, UVs, indices
- Material support: basic properties
- Scene hierarchy: parent-child transform relationships
- Animation data: keyframe extraction

## Technical Details

FBX binary structure:
- Node tree
- Property arrays with varied types
- Optional zlib compression
- Custom encoding for strings and arrays

Data extraction:
- Geometry (vertices, polygons, normals)
- UV mappings (multiple channels)
- Bone weights for skinning
- Animation curves
