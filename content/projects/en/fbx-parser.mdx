  ## Binary FBX Structure

  Node tree with typed properties:

  ```
  FBX File
  └── Node Tree
      ├── Objects
      │   ├── Geometry (mesh data)
      │   ├── Deformer (bone weights)
      │   └── AnimationCurve (keyframes)
      └── Connections (scene hierarchy)
  ```

  ## Tech Stack

  | Tech | Version | Role |
  |------|---------|------|
  | C++ | 17 | Core language |
  | CMake | 3.x | Build system |
  | zlib | 1.2 | FBX decompression |
  | FBX Binary | 7.4/7.5 | Target format |

  ## Parsing Implementation

  - Low-level node tree traversal
  - Support for v7.4 and v7.5
  - Optional zlib decompression
  - Custom string and array encoding

  ## Data Extraction

  - **Geometry**: vertices, polygons, normals, indices
  - **UVs**: multiple channels
  - **Skinning**: bone weights for skeletal animation
  - **Animation**: curves and keyframes
  - **Hierarchy**: parent-child relations with transforms

  ## Export

  - Readable JSON for debug
  - Optimized binary for runtime

# FBX Parser

Custom parser for FBX binary format, enabling import of 3D models, skeletal animations and scene hierarchies.

## Context

School project GTech3, 5 weeks. Team of 3, role: binary parser implementation.

Understanding 3D file formats is essential in game dev. This project dives into the FBX binary specification.

## School Requirements

- Parse FBX binary format (without official SDK)
- Extract basic mesh data
- Handle zlib decompression
- Document the format

## Our Implementation

Beyond basic parsing required:

- **Complete FBX parser**: support for v7.4 and v7.5
- **Advanced mesh extraction**: vertices, normals, multiple UVs, bone weights
- **Scene hierarchy**: parent-child relationship reconstruction
- **Animation data**: curve and keyframe extraction
- **Dual format export**: JSON debug + binary runtime
