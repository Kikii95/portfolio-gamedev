# FBX Parser

Custom parser for the FBX binary format, enabling import of 3D models, skeletal animations and scene hierarchies.

## Context

School project GTech3, 5 weeks. Team of 3, role: binary parser implementation.

Understanding 3D file formats is essential in game dev. This project dives into the FBX binary specification.

## Requirements

School requirements:
- Parse binary FBX format (no official SDK)
- Extract basic mesh data
- Handle zlib decompression
- Document the format

## Stack

- C++
- CMake
- FBX Binary (7.x)
- zlib (FBX compression)

## Our Implementation

Beyond the basic parsing required, we implemented:

- **Complete FBX parser**: low-level node tree traversal, v7.4 and v7.5 support
- **Advanced mesh extraction**: vertices, normals, multiple UVs, indices, bone weights for skinning
- **Full scene hierarchy**: parent-child transform relationship reconstruction
- **Animation data**: curve and keyframe extraction for skeletal animation
- **Dual export format**: readable JSON for debug + optimized binary for runtime

## Technical Details

FBX binary structure:
- Node tree
- Property arrays with varied types
- Optional zlib compression
- Custom encoding for strings and arrays

Data extraction:
- Geometry (vertices, polygons, normals)
- UV mappings (multiple channels)
- Bone weights for skinning
- Animation curves
