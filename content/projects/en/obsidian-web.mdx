# Obsidian Web

Web app to view and edit an Obsidian vault from any device. GitHub serves as the sync backend.

## Context

Personal project started in November 2025. Solo development over 2 weeks.

Initial need: access my Obsidian notes on mobile without paying for Obsidian Sync. Solution: use GitHub as a free and reliable sync layer.

## Stack

- Next.js 16, TypeScript 5.9
- TailwindCSS 4, Radix UI
- GitHub API (serverless, no backend)
- PostgreSQL (index for fast queries)
- Zustand (state management)
- CodeMirror 6 (editor)
- D3.js (graph visualization)
- Vercel (hosting)

## Features

Editing:
- CodeMirror 6 editor with keyboard shortcuts
- Full Markdown support with syntax highlighting
- Quick switcher (Ctrl+P) for fast navigation
- Automatic daily notes
- Full tag and backlink support

Visualization:
- Force-directed graph view (D3.js) of connections
- Activity heatmap (commit history)
- Media support: images, PDFs, canvas (React Flow), audio, Excalidraw

Sync & Security:
- GitHub sync, no proprietary server
- GitHub OAuth auth with encrypted JWT token
- Private notes with PIN lock
- Version history via Git commits
- Export markdown/PDF, import drag-drop

PWA:
- Installable on all devices
- Works offline
- 36 color themes (18 dark + 18 light)

## Technical Details

100% client-side architecture. No backend, all operations go directly through the GitHub API.

PostgreSQL index for fast tag/backlink/graph queries. The D3.js graph uses force-directed simulation to position nodes.

Data never passes through a third-party server: GitHub OAuth → encrypted JWT cookie token.
