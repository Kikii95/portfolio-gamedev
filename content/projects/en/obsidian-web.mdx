  ## Architecture

  100% client-side — no proprietary backend. All operations go directly through the GitHub API.

  ```
  Browser/PWA ◄──► Next.js API ◄──► GitHub API ◄──► obsidian-vault (repo)
       │                │
       └── Service Worker (Cache + Offline)
  ```

  Data flow:
  - Read: Octokit → Parse frontmatter → Extract wikilinks → Markdown render
  - Write: CodeMirror → SHA validation → GitHub commit → Sync

  ## Tech Stack

  | Tech | Version | Role |
  |------|---------|------|
  | Next.js | 16 | SSR Framework + API Routes |
  | TypeScript | 5.9 | Strict typing |
  | NextAuth.js | 5.x | GitHub OAuth + Sessions |
  | Octokit | 4.x | Official GitHub API client |
  | CodeMirror | 6 | Mobile-friendly Markdown editor |
  | D3.js | 7 | Force-directed graph visualization |
  | Zustand | 5.x | Lightweight state management |
  | PostgreSQL | 16 | Tags/backlinks/graph index |
  | TailwindCSS | 4 | Utility-first styling |

  ## Metrics & Features

  - 36 color themes (18 dark + 18 light) via OKLCH
  - Implemented phases: P0 (Auth) → P7 (CRUD Notes/Folders)
  - Offline support via Service Worker + Cache API
  - Private notes: path-based (`_private/`) + frontmatter + `#private` tag
  - Lock System: SHA-256 PIN, configurable auto-lock timer
  - Media: images, PDFs, canvas (React Flow), audio, Excalidraw

  ## Security

  - Data never passes through third-party server: GitHub OAuth → encrypted JWT cookie
  - Access restriction via `ALLOWED_USERS` (whitelist)
  - PIN hashed with SHA-256, never stored in plaintext

# Obsidian Web

Access your Obsidian notes from any device — mobile, tablet, desktop.

## Context

Personal project started in November 2025. Solo development over 2 weeks.

Initial need: access my Obsidian notes on mobile without paying for Obsidian Sync ($8/month). Solution: use GitHub as a free and reliable sync layer.

## What it does

**Editing**:
- Markdown editor with keyboard shortcuts
- Quick switcher (Ctrl+P) for fast navigation
- Automatic daily notes
- Full tag and backlink support

**Visualization**:
- Graph view of note connections
- Activity heatmap (commit history)
- Media support: images, PDFs, Excalidraw

**Mobile & Offline**:
- Installable as native app (PWA)
- Works offline
- Sync via GitHub, no proprietary server
