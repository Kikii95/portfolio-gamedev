# Obsidian Web

Web app to view and edit an Obsidian vault from any device. GitHub serves as the sync backend.

## Context

Personal project started in November 2025. Solo development over 2 weeks.

Initial need: access my Obsidian notes on mobile without paying for Obsidian Sync. Solution: use GitHub as a free and reliable sync layer.

## Stack

- React, TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- GitHub API (serverless, no backend)
- Vercel
- PWA with service worker

## Features

- Full mobile vault access
- GitHub sync, no proprietary server
- Installable PWA, works offline
- Graph view of note connections
- Automatic backlinks
- Daily notes
- Full tag support

## Technical Details

100% client-side architecture. No backend, all operations go directly through the GitHub API.

Auth via GitHub OAuth. Token stored in an encrypted JWT cookie. Data never passes through a third-party server.
