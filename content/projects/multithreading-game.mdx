# Multithreaded Game

A performance-focused game project demonstrating advanced C++ multithreading techniques for smooth gameplay.

## 🎯 Context

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 2 months |
| **Team** | Group project (4 people) |
| **Role** | Core systems developer |
| **Status** | 🟢 Completed |

This project was developed as part of my GTech3 game development curriculum, focusing on parallel processing and thread synchronization for real-time game systems.

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| Language | C++17/20 |
| Build | CMake |
| Graphics | SFML |
| Threading | std::thread, mutex, condition variables |

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Parallel Game Systems**: Separate threads for rendering, physics, and game logic
- **Thread-safe Resource Management**: Lock-free data structures where possible
- **Performance Optimization**: Profiled and optimized for consistent frame times
- **Job System**: Task-based parallelism for scalable workloads

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Thread Architecture

The game uses a multi-threaded architecture with dedicated threads for:
- Main thread: Game loop coordination and input
- Render thread: Graphics submission
- Physics thread: Collision and simulation
- Audio thread: Sound processing

### Synchronization

Implemented various synchronization primitives including mutex locks, atomic operations, and condition variables to prevent race conditions while maintaining performance.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- Deep understanding of C++ threading primitives
- Race condition debugging and prevention
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Real-time systems design

## 📚 Academic Project

This project was developed during my GTech3 studies. Code available upon request.
