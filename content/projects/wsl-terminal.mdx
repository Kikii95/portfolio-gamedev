# WSL Terminal

A modern, feature-rich terminal emulator for WSL2 built with Tauri 2.0, React 19, and xterm.js. All the features of a professional terminal, optimized for WSL development.

## 🎯 Context

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 2 weeks |
| **Team** | Solo |
| **Status** | 🟢 Complete (v0.9.3) |

Windows Terminal is good, but I wanted something with deeper developer integration — Git panels, Docker management, project navigation, and a customizable UI without electron's overhead.

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| Framework | Tauri 2.0 |
| Backend | Rust 1.77+ |
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript 5, TailwindCSS 4 |
| Terminal | xterm.js 5 with addons |
| State | Zustand |

## 🚀 Key Features

### Terminal Core
- **Multi-tab Support**: Unlimited sessions with drag-and-drop reordering
- **Split Panes**: Horizontal and vertical splits with resizable panels
- **Multi-window**: Detach tabs into separate windows
- **Session Restore**: Automatic restoration on restart
- **Search**: Full text search with Ctrl+F

### Developer Tools
- **Git Panel**: Branch management, staging, commits, push/pull
- **Docker Panel**: Container and image management
- **SSH Manager**: Save and quick-connect to SSH hosts
- **Project Switcher**: Navigate projects by category
- **Quick Commands**: Save and execute frequent commands

### UI/UX
- **6 Themes**: Catppuccin, Dracula, Nord, One Dark, Gruvbox, Tokyo Night
- **Command Palette**: Quick access with Ctrl+Shift+P
- **Quake Mode**: Dropdown terminal with customizable hotkey
- **Notifications**: Alert when long commands complete

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Performance

Lightweight compared to Electron alternatives: ~15MB installer, ~80-120MB RAM. The Tauri backend handles shell spawning and IPC, while React handles the UI efficiently.

### Shell Integration

Supports all installed WSL distributions (auto-detected), PowerShell, and CMD. The project switcher integrates with my `~/projects/` directory structure.

## 📊 Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Installer | ~15MB |
| RAM Usage | 80-120MB |
| Startup | < 1s |
